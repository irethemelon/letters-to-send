My dearest husband,

I know I've made many mistakes lately, and I'm sorry for disappointing you. I should have considered your feelings more instead of always acting on my own thoughts.

I understand that my actions have hurt you, and that's not what a good wife should do. I hope I can have the chance to make up for my mistakes and regain your trust.

I will work hard to change, to be a better person, and a better wife.

Forever yours,
Your Little Fairy
